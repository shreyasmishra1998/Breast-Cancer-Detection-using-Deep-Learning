# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

In this project I have used the Kaggle dataset of Histopathology Images of tissues which were classified into benign and malignant(0 for benign which means cancer is not present and 1 for malignant).
I have used Deep Learning to classify all the images and got an accuracy of about 86%.
